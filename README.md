# Visualization-of-sorting-techniques
Initial Results

This project consists of visualization of the basic sorting algorithms; Insertion, Bubble, Selection, Merge, and Quick. 
In the previous assignments mapped the performance of the sorting algorithms by generating the pertinent graphs. 
Like Memory management, running time and other factors. In this project we use the plotting and represent it as an animation
so that the performance of these sorting algorithms is visually perceived and evaluated. 
The imperativeness of visualization, is justified by the ease of comparisons between the speed and efficiency of the various algorithms.
In the current world speed is the most important factor but in the terms of large data we have to find a balance between speed and
the resource usage. The project comprises of the visual performance of each of the five sorting algorithms.
